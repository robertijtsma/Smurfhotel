widgets.pet.commands.description=Every Pet can level up from 1 to 20, and your Pet will gain experience whenever you train it. The more you train, the more commands your Pet will learn. However, training will also make your Pet lose energy, so make sure to feed it and let it rest in between! Please note that some foods will make your Pet regain energy faster, and feeding and scratching your Pet will also make it obey you more easily. Some commands might require accessories such as water bowls or toys.
